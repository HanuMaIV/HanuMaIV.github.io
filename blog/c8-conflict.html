          <p>Conflict is defined as "A serious disagreement or argument, typically a protracted one." This blog is going to be related to conflict.</p>
          <p>A recent conflict I have had was in deciding to move back home from Los Angeles to a small town that I currently reside in. I had lived in Los Angeles for about 8 years where I established many close relationships. I had recently graduated Yoga Teacher training and felt that something was pulling me to leave Los Angeles and share what I had learned in other places. It was a really hard decision to leave my friends. I had also felt that I had grown so much as a person living in Los Angeles. There was a fear that in moving back I would move back towards old patterns that didn't necessarily serve me well.</p>

          <p>I realized that me moving away wouldn't change anything with my friends. We might not see each other as often but that's ok. I also have been working teaching Yoga in my new town. I really enjoy it. It made my decision worthwhile. I wouldn't change anything about my decision to move back. I still miss my friends but I am grateful to be able to speak to them often.</p>

          <p>I credit my Yoga training in finding clarity to resolve my conflict. With Yoga I felt like I was better able to connect to my Dharma (right duty). I know that I have ended up in the right place for now. I look forward to spending the next few years here.</p>
