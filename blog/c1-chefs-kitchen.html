        I am nearing the end of my first week at Dev Bootcamp's phase 0. Phase 0 consists of 9 weeks of prep work before I head off to NYC for 9 weeks. During these 9 weeks I will be completing Phases 1 through 3. Looking back on this first week many feelings start to emerge into my consciousness. Excitement, anticipation, fear, frustration amongst the myriad of emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am really enjoying the Dev Bootcamp program's explorations into developing emotional intelligence. I feel that these informative presentations will be crucial in my success into this program. I am sure I will have the highest highs and lowest lows while traversing this new landscape of software development. These newfound emotional intelligence lessons will likely prove invaluable in maintaining perseverance throughout this program.
      </p>

        The group of people in my cohort (pocket gophers) seem very intelligent and genuine. I am very much looking forward to working with them further.

        The curriculum so far in this first week seems to be geared towards towards technologies and emotional intelligence. I can't wait to dive deeper. It may seem a little slow and tedious right now but I believe it will start to pick up in pace soon.

        So here I am nearing the end of week 1. I think the most noticeable thing I am feeling right now is fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of not being able to keep up. I think these feelings are natural and healthy. The key to my success in this program will be how I manage these feelings. Thanks for taking the time to read this and you'll hear from me again next week (week 2).
