        <img id="homePhoto" src="../images/brendan.jpeg" alt="Brendan Miranda Photo">
        <div class="blogEntry">
          <p>Here I am at the end of Phase 0, Unit 1 in DevBootcamp. Wow, I can say that time does go by so fast. Next thing I know I'll be in New York with all my NYC cohorts. The past 3 weeks have cultivated enormous growth not only in the technical knowledge but also my awareness as a student.</p>
          <p>Prior to the start of our phase 0 we took a learning style analysis. During that test I learned that I have a high level of Abstract Random and Concrete Random qualities in my learning style. I didn't put much thought into this at the time. This was mostly because I was in the mindset of preparing for the journey ahead of me and taking care of all my pre-curriculum requirements. But, looking back now the test really is a great representation of how I function in a learning capacity.</p>

          <h3>Concrete RANDOM Learner:</h3>
          <p>This learner likes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
            <li>take risks</li>
            <li>use their intuition</li>
            <li>solving problems independently</li>
          </ul>
          <p>They learn best when:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
              <li>able to compete with others</li>
              <li>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What's hard for them?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Restrictions and limitations</li>
              <li>Formal reports</li>
              <li>Routines</li>
              <li>Re-doing anything once it’s done</li>
              <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
              <li>Showing how they got an answer</li>
              <li>Choosing only one answer</li>
              <li>Having no options</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Abstract RANDOM Learner:</h3>
          <p>This learner likes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to listen to others</li>
              <li>bringing harmony to group situations</li>
              <li>establishing healthy relationships with others</li>
              <li>focusing on the issues at hand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They learn best when:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>in a personalized environment</li>
              <li>given broad or general guidelines</li>
              <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
              <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What's hard for them?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Having to explain or justify feelings</li>
                <li>Competition</li>
                <li>Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
                <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
                <li>Working with people who don’t seem friendly</li>
                <li>Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
                <li>Giving exact details</li>
                <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
              </ul>
              <p>After re-exploring these traits so many of them resonate as true especially after becoming reacquainted with them throughout the past 3 weeks.</p>
              <p>DevBootcamp is extremely focused towards paired programming. In this form of programming we are paired with a peer from our cohort and sometimes even a mentor guide. As my learning style suggests I like to work independently. Getting used to working with other people is often difficult for me. I often feel like it holds me back. On the other hand many of my peers have been extremely competent and have helped and provided insight into problems that I would have never had on my own. I am grateful for this disruption into my current paradigm of work flow. I am certain it will lead towards my betterment as a programmer and as a human. Based on my thinking style I am going to make an extreme effort towards solving problems on a trial and error basis and maintaining friendly relationships with my cohorts. Also since routines are hard for me I am going to put forward a plan of action to work according to a routine every week. I feel like I have a routine when it comes to my physical fitness and it's about time I applied one towards my scholastic endeavors.</p>
              <h3>Growth and Fixed Mindset</h3>
              <p>This past month I have spent much time listening to an audio book by Carol Dweck regarding the fixed and growth mindset. This is pretty revolutionary stuff for me. The basic premise is that there are two styles of mindsets that people can implement into their life.</p>
              <p>The fixed mindset is when you believe you are either good or bad at something, based on your natural abilities, in other words you are born with a specific limiting aptitude and not any growth or change occurs towards these abilities. This is a very stressful and hindering mindset to travel towards life with. Often many people don't even realize they possess this mindset as they travel through life.</p>
              <p>The growth mindset on the other hand accepts our current abilities as a state of now. It encourages positive criticism because it leads to growth. With a growth mindset we no longer have to attach to defensive tactics because we know that we are always able to move forward and better ourselves. We know we can always improve and grow.</p>
              <p>Being able to distinguish between these mindsets has been extremely liberating for me during the past month. No longer do I feel the need to be perfect at everything. I can accept my current abilities for what they are and use this awareness to systematically plan for my goals.</p>
