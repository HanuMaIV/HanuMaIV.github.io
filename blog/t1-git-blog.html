    <h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 1: All About Version Control</h1>
    <h3>A guide for the non-technical person</h3>
    <h5>Please note that version control is being presented in a context that applies to software development</h4>
    <h4>2.5.15</h4>

      <h3>What is version control?</h3>
      <p>
        Version control is software that is installed on a computer that allows a software developer to monitor changes to the files and folders on a computer. Have you ever used the undo button in a software program? If the answer is yes, then you are on your way to understanding version control. Version control is much like that undo button, but injected with steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once version control is installed on a system you can initialize it to a directory. Once initialized the software will begin to monitor for any changes to the file system, for example any new, deleted, or modified files or folders. With this monitoring a powerful set of benefits starts to emerge. Some of the benefits include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>The ability to undo changes or mistakes in your code.</li>
          <li>Documentation of what changed, when and by whom.</li>
          <li>Being able to see exactly what has changed at any given time.</li>
          <li>The ability to branch off and experiment with code without affecting your main project.</li>
          <li>Optimized use of file space for saving work.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          Some version control systems have an expanded feature set that allows you to store a main copy of your project in a centralized remote location. This method of version control is commonly referred to as "client / server based version control". Having the project stored in this method allows a high level of collaboration, redundancy and granular control to your software projects. Benefits of using a client / server based version control system are:
        <ul>
            <li>Allowing multiple developers to work on the same file(s) at the same time without fear of conflicts.</li>
            <li>Preventing developers from overwriting each other's work.</li>
            <li>Easy access to files and folders in a project</li>
            <li>Redundency and Backup</li>
        </ul >
      </p>
      <p>To summarize, version control is vital component to the development process. And while it can seem intimidating at first, if you just keep an open mind and take things one step at a time, it will become a second nature skill in your tool box.</p>
